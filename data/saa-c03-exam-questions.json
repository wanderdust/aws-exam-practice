        "answer": "Vertical scaling (scale-up) adds more resources to a single instance, such as changing an EC2 instance type to one with more vCPUs and RAM. Horizontal scaling (scale-out) adds more instances to distribute load, such as using an EC2 Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. RDS instance class modification is vertical scaling; ECS with Fargate tasks is horizontal scaling.",
