        "question": "Discuss considerations for meeting an aggressive 5-minute RPO for transaction data stored on Amazon RDS MySQL.",
        "answer": "Enable automated backups and binary log retention to allow point-in-time recovery up to the last 5 minutes. Configure multi-AZ for synchronous failover to protect against AZ failures. For cross-Region, set up an RDS read replica or Aurora global database to replicate data near-real-time. Monitor replication lag with CloudWatch and alarms. Ensure backups are copied cross-Region if compliance demands geographic redundancy.",

        "answer": "Phase 1: Discovery \u2013 Run agentless discovery to map dependencies. Phase 2: Replication \u2013 Use MGN to replicate servers to AWS, maintaining block-level sync. Phase 3: Cutover \u2013 Launch EC2 instances, update DNS, and validate functionality. Phase 4: Refactor \u2013 Containerize components using ECS or EKS, leveraging Application Load Balancer for service routing. Phase 5: Optimization \u2013 Implement Auto Scaling, CI/CD, and IaC to enhance agility and resilience.",

        "answer": "Snowmobile is a secure 100-PB semi-trailer that physically transports massive datasets to AWS, suitable for petabyte-scale migrations where network transfer would take months. Limitations include scheduling logistics that require upfront planning, and inability to provide incremental synchronization, meaning data changes after loading must be transferred separately.",

        "answer": "S3 Object Lock applies WORM protection at the object level in an S3 bucket, supporting governance or compliance modes with retention periods and legal holds. It is ideal for immutable storage of logs or records. AWS Backup Vault Lock enforces immutability on recovery points across multiple AWS services stored in a backup vault, ensuring backups cannot be altered or deleted. Choose Object Lock for application data stored directly in S3, and Vault Lock for centralized backups from services like EBS, RDS, and DynamoDB.",

        "question": "Explain how Recovery Time Objective influences architecture decisions in multi-Region deployments.",
        "answer": "A low RTO pushes architects toward always-on resources across Regions, such as active-active or warm standby architectures, to minimize startup time during a disaster. It influences the selection of globally distributed databases, automated DNS failover, Infrastructure as Code for rapid scaling, and pre-provisioned capacity. Conversely, a higher RTO allows reliance on backups and on-demand provisioning, reducing operational cost at the expense of longer recovery time.",
