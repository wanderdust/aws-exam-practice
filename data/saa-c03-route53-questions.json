        "answer": "For private endpoints, public Route 53 health checkers cannot probe the resource directly. Instead, you create a custom CloudWatch metric that represents the private resource\u2019s health, configure a CloudWatch alarm to change state when that metric crosses a threshold, and then create a Route 53 health check of type \u2018CloudWatch alarm\u2019. Route 53 updates the health check status based on the alarm\u2019s state. You can attach this health check to DNS records within a failover or multi-value routing policy, enabling automatic DNS failover even though the endpoint itself is private.",

        "answer": "Geolocation routing directs traffic based on the source location of the DNS query, determined by the requester\u2019s IP address. It is ideal for content localization, regulatory compliance, or controlled feature rollouts where user location dictates the endpoint. Latency-based routing uses measured round-trip latency between AWS edge locations and your resources to send users to the Region offering the lowest network latency. It is best for maximizing performance when you have identical stacks in multiple Regions and primary selection criteria is speed rather than user locale. Choose geolocation when location specificity outweighs latency; choose latency-based when performance is the priority and all regions provide the same content.",

Additionally, monitor query logs to identify noisy tenants and optimize or bill back excess traffic.",

When the health check fails, Route 53 automatically starts returning the standby record, directing traffic to Region B.",
